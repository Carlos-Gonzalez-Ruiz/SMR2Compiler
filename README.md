# SMR2Compiler
Compiler and emulator written in JavaScript for a fictional processor called ProcSMR2. Originally sparsely programmed between February 5-24th of 2021

This was originally an assignment I did many years ago in high school. There was also a second version of this, with many more instructions and a memory
management, where you had to load a value from memory into a register. If I recall correctly, it was possible to store up to 65536 bytes. I might reupload
this extended version someday.

Honestly, it is kind of crappy programmed. It could have been done much better and cleaner. I think this was because I was learning C
(with also bits of C++) at the time, and could only think of iterating char* with switches all the time, instead of properly using regex which might
have been a lot more efficient to compile :)

Anyway, maybe one day I will rewrite a proper port in C for both Windows and Linux if I ever get the time to do it. Mayben even with memory management and
bitwise instructions :)
